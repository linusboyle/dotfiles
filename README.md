# Dotfiles
my dotfiles:)

### Environment:

previously my laptop is:

- Deepin Linux(Currently 15.6 version)
- Deepin Desktop Environment
- i3 Window Manager

Now I switched to openSuSE,and:

- openSuSE Tumbleweed
- i3-gap
- kde plasma

By now I don't use much ricing in the KDE,most is for i3

### NOTE

some setting are shared between two desktop environments while some are i3- or dde(kde)- specific.
It may be pointed out in comment in the script

#### NOTE to myself

sometimes I forgot where to put these dotfiles,well,let's record them

- RIME setting file in `.config/fcitx/rime` ,if I'm using fcitx(mostly,I think)
- i3 config file in `.config/i3/`
- scripts,of course,in `~/bin`
- compton config file,in `.config/`
- vim: just link to home
- gdb: just link to home
- ag : just link to home
- bash: just link to home
- git: just link to home
- dunst config file in `.config/dunst`
- mpd config file in `.config/mpd`

# Dotfiles
my dotfiles:)

### Environment:

previously my laptop is:

- Deepin Linux(Currently 15.6 version)
- Deepin Desktop Environment
- i3 Window Manager

Now I switched to openSuSE,and:

- openSuSE Tumbleweed
- i3-gap
- kde plasma

By now I don't use much ricing in the KDE,most is for i3

### NOTE

some setting are shared between two desktop environments while some are i3- or dde(kde)- specific.
It may be pointed out in comment in the script
